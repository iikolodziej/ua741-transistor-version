# ua741-transistor-version
This is an application of the UA741 integrated circuit implemented with transistors.

## Introduction
Haven't you always wanted to create an integrated circuit from scratch?
See what's inside? 
How it works? 
What is it made of?
I do! 
And that's why I reproduced a popular integrated circuit that is used in many applications, and at the same time not very complicated and easy to test.
